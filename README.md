# MaterialYouColors

This was inspired by [Ch3D](https://github.com/Ch3D) material-you-colors [project](https://github.com/Ch3D/material-you-colors).  I wanted to see the exact color value of the palette in either Hex or RGB so I didn't have to use a eyedropper tool. This is written in Compose, and in of itself uses Material You in the very few places where it could be (such as the toolbar).
